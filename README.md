# Cosmic Emu

## Description

The Cosmic Emu produces predictions for the matter power spectrum based on eight cosmological parameters: omega_m, omega_w, sigma_8, h, n_s
w_0, w_a, and omega_nu. These predictions, based on Gaussian process emulation, approximate the power spectra that would be obtained from large dark matter simulations. The details are provide in "The Mira-Titan Unverse: Precision Predictions for Dark Energy Surveys" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.02654) and an upcoming paper (will be updated when posted).

## Getting Started

Details will posted when the code is available.
